# Beer Near Me! - CLI Project
Find Local Breweries in your city!

This application allows a user to input their State and City, to find local breweries in the area.
Once the state and city is inputted, the user will be given a list of all the breweries in that city, which they then can select a brewery to see more information on.

Once the user receives the data of the Brewery they've selected, they will be given an option to go back to the list and select another brewery to get more information on; or be given the option to exit the application.

This CLI project utilizes the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) api.
